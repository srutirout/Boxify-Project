## Introduction
The Boxify Sales Analysis and Inventory Insights Project focuses on leveraging data analysis techniques to derive actionable insights from sales data. By examining sales trends and inventory performance, businesses can optimize their inventory management practices to reduce costs and enhance operational efficiency.

## Dataset
The dataset, "Boxify Dataset - Data Analyst Bootcamp.csv," contains comprehensive information about orders, products, sales performance, and inventory levels.

## Project Files
- **Boxify.docx**: Detailed project requirements, objectives, and tasks, outlining the analysis scope and expected deliverables.
- **Sales Project.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing code and analysis related to the Boxify sales dataset. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to uncover sales trends and assess inventory performance.

## Analysis Overview
The analysis comprises the following steps:
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Reading and cleaning the dataset to handle missing values and ensure consistency.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing sales trends, identifying top-selling products and categories, and assessing stock levels to gain insights into sales patterns and inventory management.
3. **Inventory Metrics Calculation**: Computing metrics like inventory turnover, stock-to-sales ratio, and reorder points to evaluate inventory efficiency.
4. **Visualization**: Creating visual representations such as line charts, bar plots, and histograms to visually present the findings from the analysis.

## Usage
To execute the analysis:
- Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- Install required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run the Jupyter Notebook "Sales Project.ipynb" to perform the analysis and visualize results.
